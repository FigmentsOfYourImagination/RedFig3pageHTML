<h1>Figments of Your Imagination</h1>

<p> Figments are thoughts that someone believes to be real and unfortunately or fortunately only exist in their imagination</p>

<h2>Here are a few examples</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Any thought that is not based in reality.</li>
        <li>Imagining that a Demon has been following you your entire life  attempting to manipulate you into irrelevant contracts. </li>

        <LI>Picturing a dragon flying through the sky roaring is head down as he breathes out fire </LI>
        <img src="../Images/Dragon.jfif">
    </ul>
<h3>Are these Figments a good or bad thing?</h3>
    <p> It depends on the feeling or feelings that were gathered during the thought. What did this figment bring to you? Was it fear? Did this thought bring about immense fear that could only be generated while this thought was circulating your head?    
        Maybe this feeling of fear was still attached to you even after the thought passed and intensified when the thought snuck back into your head, or at least attempted to.  
        There are also feelings of depression, anxiety and possibly joy, happiness and love that has come from this thought you had or having now. 
        On the opposite end of fear , there is faith. Now lets imagine this figment brought you immense joy. Flowing through your heart space creating happiness. Each time you are able to think this thought, 
        this imaginative thing you feel an overwelming sense of happiness. These thoughts could be anything, anywherer and at anytime. They can last for a split second or they could take over your mind and be stuck in there for awhile long
     </p>
     <p></p>

    <p> This feeling of fear knocking at your door, following you around, stalking you waiting until had that thought again. 
        The Demon that been trying to get you to sign the contract and you believe at this point theres no way out. The outcome of this contract does harm to you. Harm that you are only thin
